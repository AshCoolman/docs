# Hi

I'm Ash, as Web developer from London.

I've made this little site to capture my writings.

### Guides

I find it useful to have a bunch of evolving documents around web technologies

### Blogging

Hm, I'm not much one for blogging generally - but I might give it a go. Jekyll makes it so easy after all.
