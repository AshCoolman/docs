# Management: alignment

# React setState callbacks vs lifeCycle

> setState() callback fires after the DOM has been updated. Think of it as componentDidUpdate(). So this also seems expected unless I'm missing something. Generally I don't recommend using setState() callbacks at all precisely because lifecycles do the same but better.

> My intuition is that you should almost never use setState callback, it's just a legacy API that happens to stick around. It has other weird edge cases too (e.g. it won't get called if you setState inside componentWillMount on the server)
