# Testing

There is something to be said for NOT exposing implementation details in your BDD. 


# Safari has anti-tracking tech

# Crypto-currency difficulty spike

tags: bitcoin,ethereum,cyrto-currency

> Earlier this week Ethereum's value dropped below $200, as soon as the currency experienced a new difficulty spike, making the currency 20% harder to mine and significantly less profitable. This combined with its decrease in value has made mining Ethereum unprofitable for many miners, especially in regions with higher than average electricity costs.
