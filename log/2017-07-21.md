# React: PropTypes are deprecated

> null props considered differently in getDefaultProps vs. isRequired

> I think the proptypes warning is a bit confusing here. It seems like isRequired should allow null since it has intention. However isRequired is equivalent to saying your type is non-nullable (which means no null nor undefined). So we don't really have a way of saying "any defined value which includes null but not undefined". Maybe we should but I don't really know how to express that.

> I wouldn't expect there to be further changes to PropTypes. Flow has become much more mature recently, and from what I heard from the React team, it is the longer term solution to type checking. This puts PropTypes into the same "compatibility" bucket in terms of prioritiesâ€”like createClass or React addons, they are still supported, but only with bugfixes and performance improvements, without adding new features or changing the API.
