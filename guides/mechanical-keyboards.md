## Vortexgear Pok3r with Cherry MX blue

Opened amazon package. "The quick br-". So fucking noisey.

## Vortexgear Pok3r with Cherry MX brown

Delicious key feel.

But I use allot of word/line navigation in OSX:

`⌥` + `→` to move cursor to end of next word
`⌘` + `→` to move cursor to end of line
`⌥` + `→` + `⇧` to move cursor to end of next word, and select movement
`⌘` + `→`  + `⇧`  to move cursor to end of line, and select movement

I want to have an approximate keymap to the default keyboard, I don't want to become a master of two completely different layouts.

My MBP bottom left...

```
shft 
fn  ctrl  cmd  alt 
```

Pok3r bottom left...
```
shift 
ctrl  cmd   alt 
```

I use `ctrl` allot with [spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) - but I needed the left `ctrl` mapped to `fn` - to trigger `ijhk` in arrow mode.

This is ok, but perhap I do want arrow keys...

Having even MORE modifiers keys, ontop of what I already have for both OSX GUI and text navigation is annoying now - I'll see how I feel after a day.
